Prof. Chang's Group
Building A Teacher-AI Collaborative System for Personalized Learning and Assessment of Comprehension Skills

Project Description
The goal of this research is to leverage automatic question-answer generation to develop an integrated system where teachers can collaborate with AI to create and customize interactive reading resources with question-answering functions for their students from kindergarten through second grade. Throughout this project, students will have a chance to 1) develop innovative AI models that expand the state-of-the-art NLP techniques (e.g., BERT, GPT) for automatically generating question-answer pairs for reading materials and customizing the training to meet the unique requirements of an educational context; and 2) building a dialog system with graphical user interfaces that is able to a) ask children a question, b) provide tailored feedback and explanation to childrenâ€™s response, and/or c) rephrase the original question (usually open-ended) to a multiple-choice question as a way of scaffolding if the children do not answer the original question or answer it incorrectly.
